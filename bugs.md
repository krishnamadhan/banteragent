2. Bug lands here with reporter, timestamp, and chat context
3. Dev reads this file at start of session, fixes open bugs
4. Update status: `OPEN` → `FIXED` with a brief note
5. Include in next `pending-release.txt` announcement

## Bug #1 — 2026-03-18 17:19:25 IST
**Reporter:** Madhu (`919159750218@c.us`)
**Status:** `FIXED`
**Description:** quiz emoji doesn’t match the movie at all

**Recent chat context:**
```
  [Harikrishnan D]: !answer anniyan
  [Harikrishnan D]: WooooWooooo
  [Madhu]: Idhuku yanaikum ena samantham
  [Madhu]: !bug
  [Madhu]: !bug quiz emoji doesn’t match the movie at all
```

**Fix notes:** Root cause — Claude was generating emojis based on movie *scenes/theme* (e.g. 🐘 for Anniyan from a movie scene) instead of the *title word* ("anniyan" = stranger → 👤❓). Fixed by rewriting the emoji quiz prompt with: (1) an explicit WRONG example using Anniyan/elephant, (2) a RIGHT example showing anniyan = stranger, (3) a self-check rule: "Does each emoji match a WORD in the title, not a scene?" (4) more title-word examples (Thuppakki=🔫, Mersal=⚡ etc.). Deploy: restart bot.

## Bug #2 — 2026-03-18 19:54:19 IST
**Reporter:** Madhu (`919159750218@c.us`)
**Status:** `FIXED`
**Description:** quiz emoji doesn’t match the movie at all

**Recent chat context:**
```
  [Madhu]: !a vellinila
  [Madhu]: !a vennila
  [Madhu]: !a nilavuku en mel ena kobam
  [Madhu]: !a chandramukhi
  [Madhu]: !bug quiz emoji doesn’t match the movie at all
```

**Fix notes:** Root cause — Claude can’t reliably generate title-word emoji clues (keeps defaulting to scene/theme emojis). Fixed by replacing AI-generated quiz entirely with a hand-curated list of 40+ Tamil movies, each with verified emoji clues that map to title WORDS (e.g., Muthu → 🦪💎, Darbar → 👑⚖️). Quiz picks randomly from the curated pool, deduplicating recently used answers. Claude is no longer involved in quiz generation. Also added `!brandquiz` with 24 curated Indian brand emoji questions. Deploy: restart bot.

## Bug #3 — 2026-03-19 12:12:21 IST
**Reporter:** Madhu (`919159750218@c.us`)
**Status:** `FIXED`
**Description:** not recognising the answers while using !a on subsequent messages

**Recent chat context:**
```
  [Madhu]: !a clue venum
  [Madhu]: !a minnale
  [Madhu]: !a minnale
  [Madhu]: Oru vatti sonna pathaadha machi
  [Madhu]: !bug not recognising the answers while using !a on subsequent messages
```

**Fix notes:** Root cause — the 8-second per-user command rate limiter was silently dropping the second `!a minnale` (Madhu typed it twice in quick succession). "Oru vatti sonna pathaadha machi" was Madhu's own message expressing frustration, not a bot reply. Fixed by exempting `!a` / `!answer` commands from rate limiting entirely — game answers are time-sensitive and must never be dropped. All other commands (quiz, news, stats etc.) retain the 8s cooldown. Deploy: restart bot.

## Bug #4 — 2026-03-19 12:42:49 IST
**Reporter:** Krishna Madhan (`919487506127@c.us`)
**Status:** `FIXED`
**Description:** movie command returns irrelevant data. Make it more interesting by adding ratings and other information to spice things up

**Recent chat context:**
```
  [Krishna Madhan]: !h
  [Krishna Madhan]: !movie coolie
  [Krishna Madhan]: Otha
  [Krishna Madhan]: !movie rajini coolie
  [Krishna Madhan]: !bug movie command returns irrelevant data. Make it more interesting by adding ratings and other information to spice things up
```

**Fix notes:** Root cause — `handleMovie` treated ALL args as a "mood" string, so `!movie coolie` asked Claude to recommend a movie for the "coolie" mood, which gave nonsense. Fixed with intent detection: if the first word is a known mood/genre word (action, comedy, sad, etc.) → mood-based recommendation; otherwise → specific movie info card. The info card includes: title, year, director, cast, IMDb rating, plot, highlight, and a Tanglish verdict. Also handles upcoming films (like Coolie) cleanly — says "Upcoming" for unreleased movies and gives what's known so far. Deploy: restart bot.

---

## Bug #5 — 2026-03-19 13:09:02 IST
**Reporter:** Krishna Madhan (`919487506127@c.us`)
**Status:** `FIXED`
**Description:** coolie is not upcoming ( 2025) is in the past

**Recent chat context:**
```
  [Krishna Madhan]: !movie coolie
  [Krishna Madhan]: !bug coolie is not upcoming ( 2025) is in the past
```

**Fix notes:** Root cause — the `!movie` info prompt told Claude to say "Upcoming" for unreleased films but didn't pass today's date, so Claude used its training knowledge bias (which may have flagged Coolie as upcoming). Fixed by injecting `getISTToday()` explicitly into the movie info prompt with instruction: "If the movie released BEFORE today's date (${today}), it is NOT upcoming — state the actual release year." Films from 2024/2025 are now correctly shown as "released". Deploy: restart bot.

## Bug #6 — 2026-03-19 17:09:10 IST
**Reporter:** Madhu (`919159750218@c.us`)
**Status:** `FIXED`
**Description:** zodiac sign usage still exists

**Recent chat context:**
```
  [Madhu]: !brandquiz
  [Madhu]: !a ola
  [Madhu]: Avlo dan repeatuu la poriya
  [Madhu]: Bye machi
  [Madhu]: !bug zodiac sign usage still exists
```

**Fix notes:** Root cause — two places were actively encouraging zodiac use: (1) `sharedRules()` in claude.ts had "mention at most once every few exchanges" which is too loose — Claude always picks zodiac as the easiest personality angle, (2) profile context mode instructions explicitly said "celebrate their zodiac traits" (nanban) and "zodiac personality type" (peter) and "vary between job, zodiac, or partner" (roast). Fixed by: replacing the loose ZODIAC RULE with a hard ZODIAC SILENCE RULE — zodiac is ONLY allowed when the user mentions it first in conversation OR it's a dedicated !astro/horoscope command. Updated all three mode instructions in getGroupProfileContext() to say "Zodiac stored for !astro only — do NOT bring up in general chat." Deploy: restart bot.

## Bug #7 — 2026-03-19 22:21:38 IST
**Reporter:** Krishna Madhan (`919487506127@c.us`)
**Status:** `FIXED`
**Description:** context of games or activities is tracked by the bot. Questions on the games and activities are not responded properly, bot has no idea of those.

**Recent chat context:**
```
  [Indhu Sravan ✨]: !a apo Preethika wood sell panitu irundha
  [Krishna Madhan]: !a siva ku odaney love start aachu
  [Indhu Sravan ✨]: !a rendu perukum fire agudhu love agudhu
  [Krishna Madhan]: Thoo nalla illa full story proper ah sollu
  [Krishna Madhan]: !bug context of games or activities is tracked by the bot. Questions on the games and activities are not responded properly, bot has no idea of those.
```

**Fix notes:** Root cause — every bot response (game questions, !debate, !storytime, !mostlikely, !roast etc.) was sent to WhatsApp but NEVER added to the group's Claude conversation history. So when users followed up ("full story proper ah sollu"), the bot had zero context of what it just said. Fixed by adding `addBotMessageToHistory(groupId, response)` + `addRecentMessage("[Bot]: ...")` in listener.ts immediately after every `sendReply()` call — both for command responses and auto-responses. Deploy: restart bot.

## Bug #8 — 2026-03-19 22:22:28 IST
**Reporter:** Krishna Madhan (`919487506127@c.us`)
**Status:** `FIXED`
**Description:** see it happened again. Typo not corrected as context is not tracked

**Fix notes:** Same root cause and fix as Bug #7 — bot's own responses now tracked in history. Deploy: restart bot.

---

## Bug #9 — 2026-03-20 12:03:23 IST
**Reporter:** Krishna Madhan (`919487506127@c.us`)
**Status:** `FIXED`
**Description:** hari responded with the option provided

**Fix notes:** Root cause — same as Bug #7/8. The bot sent a WYR/trivia/news message but it wasn't in history. Hari typed `!a B` responding to something the bot said, but the bot had no record of its own message so the context was broken. Fixed by the same history tracking fix in listener.ts. Deploy: restart bot.

---

## Bug #10 — 2026-03-20 13:48:13 IST
**Reporter:** Krishna Madhan (`919487506127@c.us`)
**Status:** `FIXED`
**Description:** we want the bot to support tvk

**Fix notes:** Added TVK political stance to `sharedRules()` in claude.ts: "When Tamil politics comes up, this group backs TVK (Vijay Makkal Iyakkam). Roast DMK and AIADMK with comedy, root for TVK. Keep it playful fan banter — never crosses into genuine hate." Deploy: restart bot.

---

## Bug #11 — 2026-03-20 15:31:32 IST
**Reporter:** Krishna Madhan (`919487506127@c.us`)
**Status:** `FIXED`
**Description:** bot has no clue about the debate message. Set this in context for better output. Include games as well

**Fix notes:** Same root cause as Bug #7/8 — !debate response was never added to history, so "Repeat?" had no context. Fixed by the listener.ts history tracking fix. Deploy: restart bot.

---

## Bug #12 — 2026-03-20 15:32:00 IST
**Reporter:** Krishna Madhan (`919487506127@c.us`)
**Status:** `FIXED`
**Description:** repeated games and activities. Redo with new set of questions and guessing games

**Fix notes:** Expanded all curated content pools: CURATED_QUIZZES 43→67 movies (+24 new Tamil films: Sethu, Naayakan, Alaipayuthey, 7G Rainbow Colony, Kaadhal Kondein, Mozhi, Pithamagan, Sillunu Oru Kadhal, Doctor, Thunivu, 2.0, Thalapathy, Kaappaan, Mudhalvan, Naan Kadavul, Pariyerum Perumal, PS2, and more). CURATED_BRAND_QUIZZES 24→36 (+Myntra, Meesho, BigBasket, Nykaa, MakeMyTrip, BYJU's, Zepto, Tata Neu, Slice, NoBroker, PharmEasy, and more). FASTFINGER_WORDS 25→57 (+Tamil cities, foods, movie titles). MOSTLIKELY_SCENARIOS 15→30 (+15 new group-relatable scenarios). STORY_STARTERS 5→10 (+5 new group-specific starters). Deploy: restart bot.

## Bug #13 — 2026-03-21 09:22:18 IST
**Reporter:** Madhu (`919159750218@c.us`)
**Status:** `FIXED`
**Description:** horoscope date is showing as 15th January 2025 but today is 21st March 2026

**Recent chat context:**
```
  [Krishna Madhan]: !news tvk
  [Bot]: Dei, news konjam neram pakkattum! 5 min-la again try pannunga 🗞️
  [Bot]: ☀️ *MORNING ROAST*

  [Bot]: 📚 *WORD OF THE DAY*

🔤 *Kavalai*
📖 Worry, anxiety, concern
💬 "Exam results vandhadhum amma ku romba kavalai aachu, but naan full confident ah irundhen!"
💡 Kavalai originally comes from the word "kaval" meaning protection - so worrying is like being a protective guard over something!
  [Madhu]: !bug horoscope date is showing as 15th January 2025 but today is 21st March 2026
```

**Fix notes:** Root cause — horoscope prompts in scheduler.ts never passed today's date to Claude, so Claude used its training-data bias and printed a stale date. Fixed by computing `todayStr` using IST offset and injecting it explicitly into both horoscope prompts (generic 12-sign fallback and personalized member horoscope): "Today is ${todayStr}" at the top of the prompt, plus a "Start with 🗓️ ${todayStr}" rule so the date appears visibly in the output. Deploy: restart bot.

## Bug #14 — 2026-03-21 10:58:18 IST
**Reporter:** Madhu (`919159750218@c.us`)
**Status:** `FIXED`
**Description:** movie names are still repeating

**Recent chat context:**
```
  [Madhu]: !a terlaye
  [Bot]: ❌ Wrong da! Hint: Kamal's comeback — a secret agent and a dangerous drug cartel
  [Madhu]: !a Vikram
  [Bot]: ✅ Correct da Madhu! 🎉

Movie: *vikram*
+10 points!

Type !quiz for next question.
  [Madhu]: !bug movie names are still repeating
```

**Fix notes:** Root cause — `MAX_RECENT_ANSWERS` was 8, so only the last 8 answers were excluded from the pool. With 67+ quiz entries, movies recycled quickly. Fixed by increasing `MAX_RECENT_ANSWERS` from 8 → 30 in games.ts. Now the bot remembers the last 30 answered movies and avoids repeating them. Deploy: restart bot.

## Bug #15 — 2026-03-22 22:41:18 IST
**Reporter:** Krishna Madhan (`919487506127@c.us`)
**Status:** `FIXED`
**Description:** refresh all the quiz, everything is getting repetitive and unrelated

**Recent chat context:**
```
  [Bot]: ✅ Correct da Krishna Madhan! 🎉

Movie: *naan kadavul*
+10 points!

Type !quiz for next question.
  [Madhu]: Naan kaduvul ah🤣🤣
  [Krishna Madhan]: Paambu enga irundhu vandhu
  [Madhu]: Onum velangala
  [Krishna Madhan]: !bug refresh all the quiz, everything is getting repetitive and unrelated
```

**Fix notes:** Root cause — (1) `naan kadavul` had emojis 📸🐍 (camera + snake) which don't match the title "Naan Kadavul" (I am God) at all. Fixed to 🙋🙏 (I + God). (2) `vikram vedha` had a duplicate entry with 🐆 emoji — removed the duplicate. (3) `mersal` used ⚡ which clashed with `minnale`'s ⚡💑 — changed to 🪄⚡ (magic + lightning, reflects Vijay's magician role). (4) Added 12 new movies to the pool (anbe sivam, kakka muttai, vaaranam aayiram, thani oruvan, kabali, puli, ok kanmani, tik tik tik, valimai, neethane en ponvasantham, vettaiyaadu vilaiyaadu). Pool now has 79+ movies. Deploy: restart bot.

## Bug #16 — 2026-03-23 23:05:46 IST
**Reporter:** Krishna Madhan (`919487506127@c.us`)
**Status:** `FIXED`
**Description:** trivia is wrong

**Recent chat context:**
```
  [Bot]: ⏰ Time up! Answer: *virender sehwag*
💡 He scored 319 against South Africa in 2008 and was originally from Tamil Nadu before moving to Delhi

Type !trivia for next question.
  [Harikrishnan D]: !ff

*VADIVELU*

Type *!a VADIVELU* — GO! 🏃
  [Harikrishnan D]: !a vadivelu
  [Krishna Madhan]: !bug trivia is wrong
```

**Fix notes:** Root cause — `startTrivia()` asked Claude to generate trivia questions, and Claude hallucinated facts (Sehwag "originally from Tamil Nadu" — he's from Haryana/Delhi). Fixed by replacing AI-generated trivia entirely with a hand-curated pool of 31 verified questions (same approach as quiz fix in Bug #2). Pool covers: TN geography, Kollywood records, BGM composers, debut films, Tamil movie remakes, food & culture, TN history, cricket. Added separate `recentTriviaAnswers` deduplication so same question doesn't repeat for 20 rounds. Deploy: restart bot.

## Bug #17 — 2026-03-24 14:46:39 IST
**Reporter:** Krishna Madhan (`919487506127@c.us`)
**Status:** `FIXED`
**Description:** we want two person to type !ff ( fast fingers game only )for the game to begin . otherwise people are getting points by playing when no one is around

**Fix notes:** Replaced `startFastFinger` with a two-phase `handleFastFinger`. Phase 1: first `!ff` creates a `fastfinger_lobby` DB record with 30-second expiry — bot announces "lobby open, type !ff to join". Phase 2: when a DIFFERENT person types `!ff`, lobby is closed and game launches immediately. If same person types again they're told to wait. If nobody joins in 30s the lobby record expires automatically (DB `expires_at` + existing `gt` filter). Solo play is no longer possible. Deploy: restart bot.

## Bug #18 — 2026-03-24 14:48:44 IST
**Reporter:** Krishna Madhan (`919487506127@c.us`)
**Status:** `FIXED`
**Description:** when ff game is dropped we want random order like reverse / original in the question for the typing order in acceptance criteria.

**Fix notes:** When the game launches (second player joins), there's a 40% chance players are asked to type the REVERSE of the shown word instead of the word itself (e.g. shown "SARPATTA", must type "ATTAPRAS"). Bot announces "🔄 Type the REVERSE of: *WORD*". State stores `isReversed` + `requiredAnswer`. `handleAnswer` checks against `requiredAnswer` (not `targetWord`). Wrong-answer hint also adapts — shows "Type the REVERSE of *WORD*" or "Type EXACTLY: *WORD*" depending on mode. Deploy: restart bot.

## Bug #19 — 2026-03-24 21:03:05 IST
**Reporter:** Madhu (`919159750218@c.us`)
**Status:** `FIXED`
**Description:** would you rather is not taking both !a or !answer for providing answers

**Recent chat context:**
```
  [Madhu]: !answer A
  [Bot]: Machaan, answer type pannu! !answer <your answer>
  [Madhu]: !answer A
  [Bot]: Machaan, answer type pannu! !answer <your answer>
  [Madhu]: !bug would you rather is not taking both !a or !answer for providing answers
```

**Fix notes:** Root cause — `handleAnswer()` had a `answer.length < 2` guard that silently rejected any single-character answer. WYR accepts "A" or "B" (1 char) so every `!a A` / `!answer A` was blocked before reaching the WYR case. Fixed by changing the guard to `answer.length < 1` (reject only truly empty input). Deploy: restart bot.

## Bug #20 — 2026-03-25 10:45:20 IST
**Reporter:** Krishna Madhan (`919487506127@c.us`)
**Status:** `FIXED`
**Description:** if a question has been used then move it archive so that it doesn’t get repeated. During each update cycle add more new questions

**Fix notes:** Replaced in-memory `recentAnswers`/`recentTriviaAnswers` Maps with a persistent file-based archive at `data/used-answers.json`. Structure: `{ groupId: { quiz, brandquiz, trivia, fastfinger: string[] } }`. All 4 game types (`startQuiz`, `startBrandQuiz`, `startTrivia`, `launchFastFingerGame`) now call `archiveAnswer()` which appends to the JSON file on disk. On bot restart, archive is loaded from disk — no repeats across restarts. When entire pool for a group+type is exhausted, `resetArchive()` clears it and the cycle starts over. `fs`/`path` imports added to games.ts. `startDialogue` (AI-based) uses quiz archive for its avoid-list too. Deploy: restart bot.

**Recent chat context:**

  [Krishna Madhan]: !bug nicknames are getting considered as different people. Inspite of valiant effort from Madhu, ai is unable to learn
```

**Fix notes:** Three-part fix in `profiles.ts`: (1) `seedKnownCouples` now uses `ilike("member_name", "Hari%")` so short names match full WhatsApp names; auto-sets short name as nickname if not already set. (2) `extractProfileInfo` detects "call me X", "my nickname is X" patterns and auto-saves nickname. (3) `getGroupProfileContext` now leads with nickname: "Hari (full name: Harikrishnan D)" + CRITICAL instruction that short names in chat must be matched to the member list, never treated as unknown extra people.

  [Krishna Madhan]: !bug wrong answer matched
```

**Fix notes:** Root cause — `fuzzyMatch` had `b.includes(a)` with no length guard. "dharmadurai" contains the letter "u" as a substring → matched. Fixed by requiring the shorter string to be at least 3 chars before the includes check fires. Deploy: restart bot.

**Fix notes:** Same root cause as Bug #22 — `fuzzyMatch` had `a.includes(b)` with no length guard. "7arivu" contains the letter "i" as a substring → matched against answer "i" (the Shankar movie). Fixed by same guard: shorter string must be ≥ 3 chars. Also added `Math.abs(a.length - b.length) > maxDist → false` early-exit to levenshtein path. Deploy: restart bot.

  [Madhu]: !bug the answer for 2 truths and one line always come in the 3rd option
```

**Fix notes:** Root cause — all 8 curated `TWO_TRUTHS_ONE_LIE` entries were authored with the lie as the 3rd statement (lieIndex: 3). Fixed in `startTwoTruthsOneLie` with a Fisher-Yates shuffle of the `statements` array before storing game state. `lieIndex` is recalculated as `shuffled.indexOf(lieText) + 1` after shuffle, so the lie lands in position 1, 2, or 3 randomly each game.

  [Krishna Madhan]: !riddle

```

**Fix notes:** Root cause — riddle prompt gave Claude no factual accuracy instructions, so it invented details (e.g. buffalo has 1 horn). Fixed by adding a STRICT ACCURACY RULES block to the riddle generation prompt: explicit animal anatomy facts (buffalo=2 horns, cow=4 legs, spider=8 legs), a "verify counts before writing" rule, and "if unsure, use a different clue" fallback.

Claude doesn't reliably maintain player hand state across turns — it invents eliminations, misidentifies players, and corrupts the game. Fixed by adding a STATEFUL GAME BAN to `sharedRules()` in claude.ts: Claude now refuses to run Blackjack/Poker/Chess/Carrom/Rummy and instead redirects to `!quiz`, `!ff`, or `!2t1l`. Deploy: restart bot.

## Bug #27 — 2026-03-26 13:10:55 IST
**Reporter:** Krishna Madhan (`919487506127@c.us`)
**Status:** `FIXED`
**Description:** response is too slow

**Recent chat context:**

Confusion-aa iruke... n
  [Krishna Madhan]: !bug response is too slow
```

**Fix notes:** Root cause — every incoming message triggered 2 serial Supabase calls (muted check + auto_response check). Fixed by introducing a 30-second settings cache in `src/group-settings-cache.ts`. Both checks now use a single combined `getGroupSettings()` call that caches `{ muted, auto_response }` per group for 30s. Cache is invalidated immediately on `!mute`/`!unmute` so muting takes effect on the very next message. Saves 1–2 DB round trips per message. Deploy: restart bot.

  [Madhu]: 🤣🤣
  [Krishna Madhan]: Nethu dhaana kalidas paathom

```

**Fix notes:** Root cause — 2T1L had 6 attempts with a hint at 3, same as quiz/trivia. But with only 3 options (1/2/3), anyone can brute-force it. Fixed by reducing to a single attempt: wrong answer immediately ends the game and reveals the lie with explanation. Right answer = +10 pts. Deploy: restart bot.

## Bug #30 — 2026-03-26 20:13:25 IST
**Reporter:** Krishna Madhan (`919487506127@c.us`)

  [Madhu]: Duplicate
  [Madhu]: Duplicate
  [Krishna Madhan]: !bug repeated questions
```

**Fix notes:** Root cause — race condition in all `startXxx` game functions. `archiveAnswer()` was called AFTER `await createGame()`. If two `!quiz` requests arrived before the first `archiveAnswer` completed (during the Supabase await), both would read the same archive state and could pick the same movie. Fixed by moving all `archiveAnswer` calls to BEFORE `await createGame` in `startQuiz`, `startBrandQuiz`, `startTrivia`, and `launchFastFingerGame`. Archive is now updated synchronously before any async yield, preventing the race. Deploy: restart bot.

**Fix notes:** Two fixes:
1. **`!cricket` showing wrong tournament** — `getLiveScores()` and `checkCricketUpdates()` now prioritize IPL matches (by name + team abbreviation detection). Falls back to all matches only when no IPL game is live.
2. **Match auto-drop missed window** — `checkAndAnnounceMatches` window expanded from "3h before match start" to "6h before", and the hard `msUntil < 0` block relaxed to 4h after start. `/api/bot/upcoming` now also returns matches that started within the last 4h (covers bot restarts mid-match).

  [Krishna Madhan]: 🥲
  [Krishna Madhan]: !bug toss never happened toss at 7 pm for today
```

**Fix notes:** Two root causes in `checkAndSendToss` (`fantasy.ts`):
1. **False early trigger** — `hasToss` was `toss_winner || playing_xi.home.length > 0`. IPL API returns probable XI *before* the actual toss, so `home.length > 0` fired 2+ hours early with no real toss. Fixed: `hasToss = !!toss_winner` only — message only sends when toss winner is confirmed.
2. **Spam on DB write failure** — `saveState` silently swallowed upsert errors (no error check on return value), so `toss_notified_at` was never persisted. Every 5-min cron re-found the same row with null and re-sent the message. Fixed: `saveState` now throws if Supabase returns an error, which aborts the send and lets the next cron retry properly. Deploy: restart bot.

## Bug #37 — 2026-04-11
**Reporter:** Harikrishnan D (session audit)
**Status:** `FIXED`
**Description:** Bot-created contest charging ₹1000 entry fee but awarding ₹0 to winners — money disappears

**Root cause:** `POST /api/bot/contest` was inserting `entry_fee: 1000` but `prize_pool: 0`. The join route deducted ₹1000 per user (`if (contest.entry_fee > 0)`). The payout route computed `calcPrizeTiers(0, ...)` → `perPlayerAmount: 0` for all ranks → nobody paid out. The announcement also incorrectly said "Entry: FREE" while the app charged 1000.

**Fix:**
1. `api/bot/contest/route.ts`: Changed `entry_fee: 1000` → `entry_fee: 0` — bot group contest is free (bragging rights only)
2. `api/admin/matches/[id]/complete/route.ts`: Added safety guard — if `prize_pool = 0` but `entry_fee_paid > 0`, auto-refund all users instead of distributing nothing
3. `api/admin/bot-contest-refund/route.ts`: NEW one-time endpoint — retroactively refunds past affected users. Call `POST /api/admin/bot-contest-refund` once after deploy.

Deploy: push ipl-fantasy → call POST /api/admin/bot-contest-refund once to fix past contests.## Bug #38 — 2026-04-11 15:56:34 IST

```

**Root cause:** All handler functions (`handleJoin`, `handleLeaderboard`, `handleStats`, `handlePlayingXI`, `handleDiff`, `handleLock`, `handleSyncXI`) used `ORDER BY scheduled_at DESC LIMIT 1` which always picks the **latest-scheduled** match — on a double-header day this is the future match, not the live one.

**Fix:** Added `getActiveState(groupId)` helper in `fantasy.ts` — fetches all non-completed announced states, partitions into started vs future, returns most-recently-started (live) first, soonest-upcoming as fallback. All handlers now use this instead of the DESC sort query. `handleGoLive` uses same partition logic inline (needs `locked_at NOT NULL` filter not in `getActiveState`).

  [Krishna Madhan]: !fb
  [Krishna Madhan]: !bug score doesn’t refresh
```

**Root cause:** Two issues:
1. `checkAndSendToss` detected the toss and saved `toss_notified_at` but never transitioned the match to `live` status in the DB. The `sync-live` cron only processes matches with `status = ‘live’`, so scoring never started — scores stayed at last-synced values.
2. `handleLeaderboard` sync had a 6s `Promise.race` timeout, but the full Cricbuzz fetch + parse + upsert + leaderboard update pipeline takes 6-8s, so the timeout fired first and stale cached data was returned.

**Fix:**
1. `checkAndSendToss` now auto-locks + auto-goes-live the match immediately after toss detected (before sending toss announcement). Also saves `locked_at` alongside `toss_notified_at`.
2. `handleLeaderboard` sync timeout increased from 6s → 12s.

  [Krishna Madhan]: !bug html returned for diff
```

**Root cause:** `diff/page.tsx` used `divideColor` as an inline style property (e.g., `style={{ divideColor: "#252D3D" }}`). `divideColor` is a Tailwind utility, not a CSS property — this caused 5 TypeScript compilation errors. The Vercel build failed, so the old deployment (without `team-diff/route.ts`) was still live. The bot hit a 404 which Next.js renders as an HTML page.

**Fix:**
1. `diff/page.tsx`: Removed all 5 invalid `divideColor` inline style properties
2. `dashboard/page.tsx`: Cast complex Supabase query to `any` to fix "type instantiation excessively deep" error
3. `handleDiff` in `fantasy.ts`: HTML responses (from 404/500) now show a friendly error instead of dumping raw HTML to WhatsApp

**Fix notes:** Root cause — the 8-second per-user command rate limiter applied to `!bug`. When Madhu typed `!quiz` immediately after `!bug`, the cooldown timer (set by `!bug`) blocked `!quiz` silently. Fixed by exempting `!bug` from rate limiting in listener.ts alongside `!answer` — bug reports are instant file writes with no abuse risk, and users naturally want to continue playing right after reporting. Deploy: restart bot.

**Fix notes:** Root cause — Claude was hallucinating IPL fixture/score data from stale training memory in free-chat responses (said "SRH" when the match was Punjab vs Mumbai). Added a CRICKET SCORES rule to `sharedRules()` in claude.ts: Claude must NEVER mention specific live scores, today's fixtures, or recent results from memory — they are stale and wrong. Instead it must redirect: "Dei, !cricket type panna live score solluven da 🏏". Deploy: restart bot.

  [Krishna Madhan]: !bug wrong match contest
```

**Fix notes:** Root cause — `preMatchCheck` queried `ba_fantasy_state` with no date filter on `scheduled_at`. The time-of-day filter (`Math.abs(h * 60 + min - targetMins) <= 35`) only compared HH:MM, so any stale match from a previous day at the same kick-off time (e.g. April 7 7:30 PM) would re-trigger on every subsequent day at 7:10 PM as long as `toss_notified_at` and `completed_at` were both NULL. Fixed by adding `gte("scheduled_at", now - 3h)` and `lte("scheduled_at", now + 3h)` to the DB query, so only matches actually scheduled near now are candidates. Also ran a one-off DB cleanup that marked 9 stale announced-but-never-completed matches (April 7–15) as `completed_at = now`. Deploy: restart bot.

RLS on `f11_entries` only allows users to see their own entries when a match is `open`/`locked` (policy: `entries_read_own`). So the count always returned 1 (their single joined entry) instead of the real total across all users. Fixed by removing the inline count from the user client query, then separately counting all entries using `createServiceClient()` (service role bypasses RLS) and merging counts into the contests array. Deploy: push ipl-fantasy.

**Fix notes:** Root cause — when `!fl` is called the moment a match goes live, the Cricbuzz score sync hasn't populated fantasy points yet. The bot fell through with cached 0-pt leaderboard data and displayed it as truth. Fixed by detecting the all-zero case during a live contest and returning a "scores still syncing, try again in 2 minutes" message instead of a misleading all-zero board. Deploy: restart bot.

Ey, did you know Rajini's iconic "Magizhchi" dialogue in Muthu was completely unscripted da? 🎬 

Director Balu Mahendra told him to just react naturally when the heroine accepts his proposal - so our Thalaiva went "Magizhchi, magizhchi!" and did that trademark hand gesture spontaneously! 

The whole crew burst out laughing, but Balu kept the take. Now half of TN uses that word for happiness, thanks to one improvised moment! 😄

Mass ah illa mokka ah? 🔥

```

**Fix notes:** Full integration audit of ipl11.vercel.app. Four root causes found:

1. **Login/register pages broken** — Both had `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` inside `"use client"` components. This directive is silently ignored in client components, but caused Next.js to serve an inconsistent cached/dynamic hybrid that broke the post-login redirect in some cases. Removed the invalid export.

2. **User data pages serving stale/wrong-user data** — Dashboard, contests, wallet, profile, and leaderboard pages all had `export const revalidate = 30` (or 60). Next.js caches server component output for that duration, sharing one user's data with all users who request the same page within the window. Changed all to `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` to ensure every request respects the authenticated session.

3. **All game pages crashing with 500** — `AppHeader.tsx` (rendered by the shared `(game)/layout.tsx`) used `.single()` to fetch the user's profile. `.single()` throws a PostgREST error when no row is found (e.g. auth user exists but profile wasn't created by the DB trigger). Since AppHeader wraps every game page, a missing profile crashed the entire app. Fixed by switching to `.maybeSingle()` in AppHeader, dashboard, wallet, and profile pages.

4. **Login/register pages rendered as `○ (Static)`** — After fixing #1, these pages now correctly pre-render as static HTML since they contain no server-side dynamic data.
